<H1>Abstract</H1>

A mechanism is proposed to allow Scheme code to report errors and abort
execution.
The proposed mechanism is already implemented in several Scheme systems
and can be implemented, albeit imperfectly, in any R5RS conforming Scheme.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>
R5RS Scheme requires certain operations to signal an error when they fail.
"Signalling an error" means that implementations must detect and report
the error.
Moreover, R5RS encourages, but not requires, 
implementations to signal an error in many more circumstances.

<p>
However, there is no direct way for the Scheme application programmer to report
an error that occured in his or her own application. 
This means that Scheme procedures created by applications or libraries are
in this respect not on equal footing with procedures provided by the
Scheme system.

<p>
Many Scheme systems already provide a mechanism that allows application code
to report an error. At least the following implementations support
such a mechanism: Bigloo, Guile, MIT Scheme, MzScheme, RScheme, Scsh, SCM,
all implementations supported by SLIB.
Of these implementations, the following have an error mechanism compatible
with this SRFI: Guile, MIT Scheme, MzScheme, RScheme, Scsh. The error
mechanism in Bigloo conflicts with this SRFI, but this can be easily
remedied. The implementation in SLIB just has a different name than the
one proposed in this SRFI.

<p>
To summarise, many implementations already have the error reporting
mechanism described in this SRFI, and others are easily made compatible
with this SRFI. This shows that the proposed mechanism is considered useful
and that it is easy to implement in most major implementations.

<H1>Specification</H1>

<p>
The following procedure should be provided:
<p>
<code>(error</code> &lt;message&gt;<code> [&lt;obj1&gt; [&lt;obj2&gt; ...]])</code>
<p>
The argument &lt;message&gt; should be a string.
The procedure or special form <code>error</code> will <em>signal an error</em>,
as described in R5RS, and it will report the message &lt;message&gt;
and the objects &lt;obj1&gt, &lt;obj1&gt. 
What exactly consitutes "signalling" and "reporting" is not prescribed, because of the large variation in Scheme systems. So it is left to the implementor
to do something reasonable. To that end, a few examples of possible behaviour
are given.
<ol>
 <li>
   Display &lt;message&gt; and &lt;obj1&gt;... on the screen and terminate
   the Scheme program. (This might be suitable for a Scheme system
   implemented as a batch compiler.)
 <li>  
  Display &lt;message&gt; and &lt;obj1&gt;... on the screen and  
  go back to the read-evaluate-print loop. (This might be suitable for
  an interactive implementation).
 <li>
  In the case of a multi-threaded system: terminate the current
  thread, but do not terminate the other threads. Possibly make the
  arguments to <code>error</code> available to other threads in some
  way. See the <code>thread-join!</code> mechanism in SRFI-18 on
  how this could be done.
 <li>
  Package &lt;message&gt; and &lt;obj1&gt;... up into an error object
  and pass this error object to an exception handler. The default
  exception handler then might do something as described in points 1 to 3.
 <li>
  In the case of a Scheme system that returns completely unattended
  and that has no way to notify a human, the only reasonable
  course of action might be to do nothing at all. However, this should
  be considered a last resort. Clearly, if all implementors would choose
  this strategy, this SRFI would not be very useful.
</ol>  
An implementation might report more information than just 
&lt;message&gt; and &lt;obj1&gt;... . For instance, it might report the procedure name in which
the error occured or even print a stack trace.
To make is easier for implementors to add such useful information, it is not
required for <code>error</code> to be a procedure. However, it is
still allowed to be a procedure.


<H1>Implementation</H1>

An implementation that works in almost any R5RS Scheme is the following:
<pre>
  (define (error message . objs)
      (display "Error: ")
      (display message)
      (for-each display objs)
      (newline)
      (scheme-report-environment -1))  ;; we hope that this will signal an error
</pre>
This implementation has a flaw,
namely, in many implementations this
will actually print 2 messages.
<ol>
 <li> The message <code>message</code>, followed by <code>objs</code>, and
 <li> A message about <code>scheme-report-environment</code> getting an invalid argument. 
</ol> 
This might be confusing to the user.

<p>
The SLIB procedure <code>slib:error</code> works like the <code>error</code>
procedure described in this document.
Thus, when SLIB is loaded, <code>error</code> can be defined as:
<pre>
  (define error slib:error)
</pre>  

<p>
If SRFI-18 is supported, it is allowed to implement <code>error</code> in
terms of the exception mechanism of SRFI-18.
<pre>
  (define (error message . objs)
    (raise (make-error-exception msg objs)))
</pre>
Here, <code>make-error-exception</code> is implementation dependent.
